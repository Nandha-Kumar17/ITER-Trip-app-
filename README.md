## CRUX
We get the current location of the user and places info from the google API around the user. Since nearby API shows places around 50KM radius so we calculate the farthest point from the current location for all 8 directions and then we calculate from the farthest place of all 8 directions .(Distance and Directions are calculated using co-ordinates)
